# Tetris

For my PIC 10C Final Project, I created a tetris game in Visual Studio 2015, using the SFML Graphics Library.

Here is a link to a video demonstrating how the game works: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0DGy_uE-TVbaklsVEx1NXJmcEE/view?usp=sharing

## Prerequisites
To run the program, you will need to install SFML. Here is a link to a tutorial on how to set up SFML with the Visual Studio IDE: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.3/start-vc.php

## PIC 10C Concepts
- lambda functions
- pointers to objects on the heap
- "signals and slots" analogous to Qt Creator
- RAII principles
